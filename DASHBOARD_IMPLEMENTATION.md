# Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

The dashboard has been fully implemented and integrated with the Retail Execution Audit System API. It provides real-time data visualization for audit statistics, recent audits, and upcoming assignments.

## Features

### 1. Real-time Data Integration
- **API Integration**: Connected to the backend API endpoints for dashboard data
- **Authentication**: Uses JWT tokens for secure API calls
- **Universal Access**: Uses the general dashboard endpoint accessible to all users

### 2. Dashboard Components

#### Stats Cards
- **Total Audits**: Shows the total number of audits with change indicators
- **Completion Rate**: Displays completion percentage with trend data
- **Critical Issues**: Shows number of critical issues found
- **Active Auditors**: Displays count of currently active auditors

#### Recent Audits Section
- Lists the most recent audit submissions
- Shows audit status with color-coded badges
- Displays auditor name, store information, and scores
- Includes completion dates

#### Upcoming Assignments Section
- Shows scheduled audits and their deadlines
- Displays priority levels with color-coded badges
- Shows assigned auditor and store information
- Includes due dates

### 3. User Experience Features

#### Loading States
- Skeleton loading animations for stats cards
- Loading indicators during data refresh
- Smooth transitions between states

#### Error Handling
- Graceful error display with retry functionality
- Toast notifications for API errors
- Fallback to default values when data is unavailable

#### Refresh Functionality
- Manual refresh button with loading state
- Automatic data refresh on component mount
- Token expiration handling

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`lib/dashboard-service.ts`** - New service for API calls
2. **`components/dashboard.tsx`** - Updated dashboard component
3. **`app/layout.tsx`** - Added Toaster component for notifications

### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/v1/Dashboard` - Get dashboard data for all users
- `DELETE /api/v1/Dashboard/cache/clear` - Clear dashboard cache

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: User logs in and receives JWT token
2. **Data Fetching**: Dashboard service makes authenticated API calls
3. **State Management**: React state manages loading, data, and error states
4. **Rendering**: Component renders data with appropriate UI states
5. **User Interaction**: Refresh button allows manual data updates

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **Network Errors**: Display user-friendly error messages
2. **Authentication Errors**: Redirect to login on token expiration
3. **Data Errors**: Show fallback UI with retry options
4. **Loading Errors**: Provide skeleton loading states

## Usage

### For Users
1. Log in to the system
2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. View real-time audit statistics
4. Check recent audit submissions
5. Review upcoming assignments
6. Use the refresh button to update data

### For Developers
1. The dashboard automatically fetches data on mount
2. Uses the general `/api/v1/Dashboard` endpoint for all users
3. Error states are handled gracefully with retry options
4. Loading states provide good user experience

## Configuration

### API Base URL
The dashboard service uses the same API base URL as other services:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://test.scorptech.co/api/v1';
```

### Authentication
Uses the existing auth context for token management and user details.

### Toast Notifications
Integrated with the existing toast system for error notifications.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Regional Performance**: Currently commented out, can be enabled when needed
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data updates
3. **Customizable Dashboard**: User-configurable widgets and layouts
4. **Export Functionality**: PDF/Excel export of dashboard data
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Date range and status-based filtering

## Testing

The dashboard can be tested by:
1. Starting the backend API server
2. Running the frontend application
3. Logging in with valid credentials
4. Navigating to the dashboard
5. Testing the refresh functionality
6. Verifying error handling by temporarily disabling the API

## Dependencies

- React hooks for state management
- Lucide React for icons
- Radix UI components for UI elements
- Custom toast system for notifications
- Authentication context for user management
