# Assignments Page Implementation

## Overview
The assignments page has been made fully functional with real API integration, comprehensive error handling, and role-based access control. This implementation follows the patterns established in the Python test script and integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication and organization management systems.

## Key Components

### 1. Assignment Service (`lib/assignment-service.ts`)
A comprehensive service layer that handles all assignment-related API operations:

**Features:**
- Full CRUD operations for assignments
- Specialized endpoints (upcoming, overdue, by status, by priority)
- Statistics calculation
- Store information parsing and formatting
- Proper error handling and TypeScript interfaces

**API Endpoints Covered:**
- `GET /Assignments` - Get all assignments (with optional organization filter)
- `GET /Assignments/{id}` - Get specific assignment
- `GET /Assignments/my-assignments` - Get user's assignments (for auditors)
- `GET /Assignments/upcoming` - Get upcoming assignments
- `GET /Assignments/overdue` - Get overdue assignments
- `GET /Assignments/by-status/{status}` - Filter by status
- `GET /Assignments/by-priority/{priority}` - Filter by priority
- `POST /Assignments` - Create new assignment
- `PUT /Assignments/{id}` - Update assignment
- `PATCH /Assignments/{id}/complete` - Mark assignment as complete
- `DELETE /Assignments/{id}` - Delete assignment

### 2. Assignments Component (`components/assignments.tsx`)
The main assignments page with comprehensive functionality:

**Features:**
- Role-based data loading (auditors see only their assignments)
- Real-time statistics dashboard (5 key metrics)
- Advanced search and filtering (by status and priority)
- Overdue assignment highlighting
- Loading states and error handling with retry functionality
- Responsive design with proper mobile support
- Refresh functionality

**Role-Based Behavior:**
- **Auditors**: See only their assigned audits, cannot create assignments
- **Managers/Supervisors/Admins**: See all organization assignments, can create new assignments

### 3. Create Assignment Dialog (`components/create-assignment-dialog.tsx`)
Fully functional assignment creation with real API integration:

**Features:**
- Dynamic template loading from API
- Dynamic auditor loading (filtered to active auditors only)
- Form validation and error handling
- Loading states during submission
- Proper date validation (minimum date is today)
- Store information capture
- Priority and notes support

**Data Flow:**
1. Loads available templates and auditors when dialog opens
2. Validates all required fields before submission
3. Creates assignment via API
4. Refreshes parent assignments list on success
5. Provides detailed error feedback

### 4. Navigation and Access Control
Updated navigation to support auditor role:

**Access Levels:**
- **Dashboard**: All roles (admin, manager, supervisor, auditor)
- **Assignments**: All roles (different views based on role)
- **Audits**: All roles (auditors see their own audits)
- **Templates**: Admin and Manager only
- **Reports**: Admin, Manager, Supervisor only
- **Users**: Admin and Manager only
- **Logs**: Admin only
- **Settings**: All roles (different tabs based on role)

## Data Models

### Assignment Interface
```typescript
interface Assignment {
  assignmentId: string;
  templateId: string;
  templateName?: string; // Populated from joins
  assignedToId: string;
  assignedToName?: string; // Populated from joins
  assignedById: string;
  assignedByName?: string; // Populated from joins
  organisationId: string;
  storeInfo: string; // JSON string
  dueDate: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  notes?: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled' | 'expired' | 'fulfilled';
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### Store Information
```typescript
interface StoreInfo {
  storeName: string;
  storeAddress: string;
  [key: string]: any; // Allow additional properties
}
```

### Assignment Statistics
```typescript
interface AssignmentStats {
  total: number;
  pending: number;
  inProgress: number;
  completed: number;
  overdue: number;
  cancelled: number;
}
```

## API Integration

### Authentication
All API calls use JWT bearer token authentication from the auth context.

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with:
- Network error detection
- API error message parsing
- User-friendly error display
- Retry mechanisms
- Fallback data for development

### Organization Context
Assignment operations are scoped to the user's organization:
- Managers/Supervisors/Admins see all organization assignments
- Auditors see only their own assignments
- Assignment creation is scoped to the user's organization

## UI/UX Features

### Statistics Dashboard
5-card dashboard showing:
- Total assignments
- Pending assignments
- In-progress assignments
- Overdue assignments (highlighted in red)
- Completed assignments (highlighted in green)

### Search and Filtering
- Text search across assignment ID, template name, auditor name, and store name
- Status filter dropdown (all, pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled, expired)
- Priority filter dropdown (all, high, medium, low)
- Real-time filtering with result count display

### Visual Indicators
- Overdue assignments highlighted with red background
- Color-coded status badges
- Color-coded priority badges
- Loading spinners and states
- Empty state with helpful messaging

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Flexible grid system
- Proper spacing and typography
- Accessible color contrast

## Integration Points

### Authentication Context
- Uses `useAuth()` hook for user and token access
- Respects user roles for feature access
- Handles authentication state changes

### Organization Service
- Integrates with organization member management
- Loads active auditors for assignment creation
- Respects organization boundaries

### Template Service
- Loads available templates for assignment creation
- Ensures only valid templates can be assigned

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation with retry options
2. **Authentication Errors**: Proper error messages and auth state handling
3. **Validation Errors**: Form-level validation with specific error messages
4. **API Errors**: Server error message display with retry functionality
5. **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading indicators
6. **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data is available

## Performance Considerations

1. **Parallel API Calls**: Template and auditor data loaded simultaneously
2. **Efficient Filtering**: Client-side filtering for responsive search
3. **Minimal Re-renders**: Proper state management and useEffect dependencies
4. **Lazy Loading**: Data loaded only when needed (dialog opens, component mounts)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. Assignment bulk operations
2. Assignment templates/presets
3. Calendar view for due dates
4. Assignment notifications
5. Assignment history/audit trail
6. Advanced filtering (date ranges, custom fields)
7. Export functionality
8. Assignment analytics and reporting

## Testing

The implementation is based on the comprehensive Python test script which covers:
- Assignment CRUD operations
- Role-based access control
- Error handling scenarios
- API endpoint validation
- Data integrity checks

All major user flows have been implemented with proper error handling and user feedback.
